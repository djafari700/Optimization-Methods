# Optimization-Methods
Welcome to the fourth (required) assignment of Course 2 of the Deep Learning Specialization! In this notebook, you'll gain skills with some more advanced optimization methods that can speed up learning and perhaps even get you to a better final value for the cost function. Having a good optimization algorithm can be the difference between waiting days vs. just a few hours to get a good result.
